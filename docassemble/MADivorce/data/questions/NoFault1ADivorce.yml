  Health insurance law is very complicated. Your divorce affects your health care coverage when you are on the same plan. You must find out what happens when your divorce is final, when one of you remarries, or the employee leaves the job, or the employer changes plans. You must decide who will pay for the coverage and who will pay the extra income tax that the IRS may charge after your divorce.
  
  As agreed upon both spouses, please choose the plan for when the divorce is finalized:
